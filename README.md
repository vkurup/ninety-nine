## Ninety Nine

This is a program which calculates the
[ninety-nine day high signal](http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=27442724),
described by mungofitch over at The Motley Fool investment message boards.

The basic premise is that when the S&P stops making new highs, investors
get pessimistic and stocks fall. When it starts making new highs again,
optimism takes over and bull markets start. The ninety-nine day signal has 2
parts and coincidentally uses 99 days as the cut-off for both parts. It
looks at whether a new high has been made recently. It defines "high" as a
99 day high. It defines "recently" as 99 days. So, it looks for a new
99-day high within the last 99 days. The number is arbitrary. Hop over the
the Motley Fool boards to look how the dates have been tuned and pick
different ones, if you like.

I like this one, because it's simple, easy to calculate and doesn't have
many "signals", so you're not constantly buying and selling. It's, of
course, not perfect, but it would have gotten you out of most of the major
bear markets.
